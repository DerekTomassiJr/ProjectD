1) Just like the previous Projects I did all of this alone

Some things to note about my code.
  For some reason with the copy command I couldn't get it to work with shell, but it would work for any other file. It works if I hard code the String "shell" into the function, but there was a problem with the variable pass through and when attempting to fix it I just broke it and no file worked. So I brought it back to the old way I had it and it works for everything except shell.
  With the create textfl command I having working well the only thing is I had a problem with finding the end of a line. To fix that (I also state this in my command line) you need to put a | character at the end of each line to indicate the end of your line.
