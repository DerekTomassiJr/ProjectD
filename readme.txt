Derek Tomassi Project C

So for this project we had to write several new function with the readFile() and executeProgram() functions as well as create the terminate() function along with making a shell.c file. I worked alone so I did all the work. I wasn't able to get shell to print an error message for the exec command for some reason if I use executeProgram in kernel.c it will print the error message, but through shell it won't print. I left all the test code in the main() function just commented out so you can verify my code with that.
